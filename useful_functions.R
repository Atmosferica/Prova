# These are some useful functions I wrote, they are for printing plots on file and check if dir exist.

#This is a simple function for plotting on a file. Once you have the object "plot",
#you pass it as an argument together with width, heigth and the name of the file where do you want to plot.
print_plot<-function(x,w,h,filename){
  png(file=filename, width=w, height=h, units='px', res=96, type='cairo')
  print(x)
  dev.off()
  rm(x)
}


#This function is only a concatenation of dir.exist() and dir.create(): when you're sure that there is a dir
#with the name chosen, it changes and returns the path to let you use it as a parameter in the filename
create_directory<-function(path){
  if(dir.exists(path)!=TRUE){
    dir.create(path)
  }
  path<-paste(path,'/',sep='')
  return(path)
}
